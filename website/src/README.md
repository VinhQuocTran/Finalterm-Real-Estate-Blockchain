# Asset transfer basic sample
The asset transfer basic sample demonstrates:

- Connecting a client application to a Fabric blockchain network.
- Submitting smart contract transactions to update ledger state.
- Evaluating smart contract transactions to query ledger state.
- Handling errors in transaction invocation.

## About the sample

This sample includes smart contract and application code in multiple languages. This sample shows create, read, update, transfer and delete of an asset.

For a more detailed walk-through of the application code and client API usage, refer to the [Running a Fabric Application tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html) in the main Hyperledger Fabric documentation.

### Application

Follow the execution flow in the client application code, and corresponding output on running the application. Pay attention to the sequence of:

- Transaction invocations (console output like "**--> Submit Transaction**" and "**--> Evaluate Transaction**").
- Results returned by transactions (console output like "**\*\*\* Result**").

### Smart Contract

The smart contract (in folder `chaincode-xyz`) implements the following functions to support the application:

- CreateAsset
- ReadAsset
- UpdateAsset
- DeleteAsset
- TransferAsset

Note that the asset transfer implemented by the smart contract is a simplified scenario, without ownership validation, meant only to demonstrate how to invoke transactions.

## Running the sample

The Fabric test network is used to deploy and run this sample. Follow these steps in order:

1. Create the test network and a channel (from the `test-network` folder).
   ```
   ./network.sh up createChannel -c mychannel -ca
   ```

1. Deploy one of the smart contract implementations (from the `test-network` folder).
   ```
   # To deploy the javascrip chaincode implementation
   # ./network.sh deployCC -ccn basic -ccp ../src/chaincode/ -ccl javascript

   ```

1. Run the application (from the `asset-transfer-basic` folder).
   ```
   # To run the javascript sample application
   cd application
   npm install
   node index.js
   ```
## Clean up

When you are finished, you can bring down the test network (from the `test-network` folder). The command will remove all the nodes of the test network, and delete any ledger data that you created.

```
./network.sh down
```
